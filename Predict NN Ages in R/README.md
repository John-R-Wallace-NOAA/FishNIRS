<h3>Predicting Neural Net Ages in R under Windows

<h4>What's missing
  
The Anaconda environment necessary for the R package 'tensorflow' to work is missing from the folder 'FCNN Model' since it is too large to be loaded into GitHub. Contact the author for a copy (John.Wallce@noaa.gov).

<h4>Making it work

- Copy this repo's files and folder structure to a Windows 10 or 11 machince.
- Put the Anaconda environment obtained from the author into the 'FCNN Model' directory.
- Double click 'Predict New Ages.bat' to run the batch file in Windows. The batch file uses'Rscript.exe' to run 'Predict_NN_Age_Script.R".
- Likewise you can source 'Predict_NN_Age_Script.R' into R or copy paste the code into R's Command Window.
