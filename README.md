<h3> Neural Net Models </h3>

The Hake scripts in 'R_NN_Model_Hake_Scripts' are cleaned up.  All other species to be looked at, including Sablefish, will start will this code with the species changed. A function taking a species name would be possible in the future.


<h3> Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) on fish structures </h3>



The directory structure used by readSpectraData() is for the R working directory to be directly below the current directory:

     ../R 
     
with the spectra data to be beside it in:

    ../OPUS Spectra
    
 and the downloads for the data to be in this format:
 
     ../OPUS Spectra/1_2019_11
     ../OPUS Spectra/2_2019_12
     ../OPUS Spectra/3_2020_01
     ...
     
     ../OPUS Spectra/10_2020_10
