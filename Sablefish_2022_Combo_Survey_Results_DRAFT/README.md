## Sablefish 2022 Combo Survey Results ##
A Neural Net (NN) training model with 1,528 otoliths was run to compare Near Infrared Scans (NIRS) to the Traditional Method of Aging (TMA).  The total number of oties predicted was 1,553; 15 otoliths were not used for trainning to look for bias.

Metadata was added to the scans for a better fit.
