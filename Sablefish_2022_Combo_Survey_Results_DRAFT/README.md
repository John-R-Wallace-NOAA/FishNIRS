## Sablefish 2022 Combo Survey Results ##
A Fully Connected Neural Net (FCNN) training model using 1,528 otoliths with 20 random full fold models was run to compare Near Infrared Scans (NIRS) to the Traditional Method of Aging (TMA).  Fifteen otoliths were not used for trainning to look for bias. The total number of oties predicted was 1,553.

Metadata was also added to the scans for a better fit.  

The best [prediction](/Sablefish_2022_Combo_Survey_Results_DRAFT/Sable_2022_Combo_Scans_Otie_Wgt_Fish_Len_Weight_Depth_Lat_Agreement_Fig.png), with an impressive R Squared of 0.9669, was found using the NIRS scans with the metadata of otolith weight, fish length, fish weight, depth, and latitude.  Other metadata looked but no included in the model were sex, month, and days into the year.


The best [prediction](/Sablefish_2022_Combo_Survey_Results_DRAFT/Sable_2022_Combo_Otie_Wgt_Fish_Len_Weight_Depth_Metadata_Only_Agreement_Fig.png), only using metadata (no scans), had an R squared of 0.8770 using otolith weight, fish length, fish weight, and depth. Adding latitude to the metadata only model did not work well.
