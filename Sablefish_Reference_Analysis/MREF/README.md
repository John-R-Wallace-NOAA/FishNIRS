For quality control, four otoliths from three different species are scanned in the morning before production scanning commences. This is done regardless of species being scanned that day (or session). These are the "MREF" scans. More MREF scans may be done throughout the day to look for issues that need investigating.  Sablefish, with their naturally small size, is one of the three MREF species and those otolith reference scans are looked at below.

A large Fully Connected Neural Net (FCNN) model with spectra scans and metadata from 5,235 Sablefish otoliths collected on the 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021 NWFSC Bottom Trawl Surveys (All_Oties_2017_18_19_21) was used to predict the age of the four Sablefish reference otoliths. The metadata consisted of otolith weight, fish length, fish weight, and depth of capture. This [agreement figure](/Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Agreement_Figure_Sable_Combo_All_Oties_2017_18_19_21.png) shows the prediction of ages vs the traditional method of aging (TMA) for all the otoliths in the model and for the 1,553 otoliths from the 2022 survey, which were not included in the FCNN model (5,235 + 1,553 = 6,788). 

The four Sablefish reference otoliths have TMA ages of 2, 18, 38, and 51. The FCNN model was used to predict ages from each daily scan which were [plotted]("/Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Sablefish Ref Oties, All Oties 2017_18_19_21, NN_Pred_Median by Days_from_First_Use.png") against a timeline of days since first use.
