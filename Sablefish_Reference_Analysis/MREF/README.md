For quality control, four reference otoliths from three different species are scanned in the morning before production scanning commences. This is done regardless of species being scanned that day (or session). These are the "MREF" scans. More MREF scans may also be done throughout the day if there are issues that need investigating.  Sablefish, with their relatively small sized otoliths, is one of the three MREF species and those otolith reference scans are looked at below.

A large Fully Connected Neural Net (FCNN) model with spectra scans and metadata from 5,235 Sablefish otoliths collected on the 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021 NWFSC Bottom Trawl Surveys (All_Oties_2017_18_19_21) was used to predict the age of the four Sablefish reference otoliths. The metadata consisted of otolith weight, fish length, fish weight, and depth of capture. This [agreement figure](/Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Agreement_Figure_Sable_Combo_All_Oties_2017_18_19_21.png) shows the prediction of ages vs the traditional method of aging (TMA) for all the otoliths in the model and for the 1,553 otoliths from the 2022 survey, which were not included in the FCNN model (5,235 + 1,553 = 6,788). 

The four Sablefish reference otoliths have TMA ages of 2, 18, 38, and 51. The FCNN model was used to predict ages from each daily scan which were [plotted](/Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Sablefish_Ref_Oties_All_Oties_2017_18_19_21_NN_Pred_Median_by_Days_from_First_Use.png) against a timeline of days since first use of the Bruker Tango in Newport, OR. (Not every day is scanning day, of course.)

Another FCNN [model](/Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Agreement_Figure_Sable_Combo_Rdm_500N_2017_18_19_22_200N.png), utilizing 500 random selected otoliths from each of the 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021 NWFSC Bottom Trawl Surveys, plus an additional 200 randomly selected from 2022, were also used to predict the four reference otoliths in the same [manner](/Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Sablefish_Ref_Oties_2200_Multi_17_22_NN_Pred_Median_by_Days_from_First_Use.png)

Before the otoltih weights of the MREF Sablefish were obtained, the 2022 (survey) spectra only [model](/Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Agreement_Figure_Sable_Combo_2022_Spectra_Only.png) was appplied to the four [ololiths](/Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Sablefish_Ref_Oties_2022_Spectra_Only_NN_Pred_Median_by_Days_from_First_Use.png).

Lastly, since the four Sablefish reference otoliths are from 2019, the spectra/meta [model](/Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Agreement_Figure_Sable_Combo_2019_Model.png) from only 2019 was also applied to the four otoliths. Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of older Sablefish in 2019 for the model to work with, and the total number, with a complete set of metadata, only comes to 750. (The total number of scans was 802.) However, it is instructive to include it [here](\Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Sablefish_Ref_Oties_2019_Spectra_Meta_NN_Pred_Median_by_Days_from_First_Use.png).
