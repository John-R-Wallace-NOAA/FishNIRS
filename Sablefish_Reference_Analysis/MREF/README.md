For quality control, four otoliths from three different species are scanned in the morning before production scanning commences. This is done regardless of species being scanned that day (or session). These are the "MREF" scans. More MREF scans may be done throughout the day to look for issues that need investigating.  Sablefish otoliths, with their naturally small size, is one of the three MREF species and those reference scans are looked at below.

A large Fully Connected Neural Net (FCNN) model with spectra scans and metadata from 5,235 Sablefish otoliths collected on the 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021 NWFSC Bottom Trawl Surveys (All_Oties_2017_18_19_21) was used to predict the age of the 4 Sablefish reference otoliths. The metadata consisted of otolith weight, fish length, fish weight, and depth of capture. This [agreement figure](Sablefish_Reference_Analysis/MREF/Figures/Agreement_Figure_Sable_Combo_All_Oties_2017_18_19_21.png/) shows the prediction of ages vs the traditional method of aging (TMA) for all the otoliths in the model and for the 1,553 otoliths from the 2022 survey, which were not included in the FCNN model (5,235 + 1,553 = 6,788).
