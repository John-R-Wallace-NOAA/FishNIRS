Bias Correction for Older Predicted ages

Since the NN prediction bias in older ages is consistently in one direction it can be adjusted for.

The bias correction needs to be done not only when a TMA (Tradional Method of Aging) is given but also when there is no corresponding TMA for a given age structure. Hence the goal of a new bias corrected prediction, from scans and/or metadata but without a  TMA, can be acheived.
